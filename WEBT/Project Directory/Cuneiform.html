    <h1>History of Writing</h1>
      <p>
        In the history of the representation of language through graphic means, <br>
         various human civilizations have evolved.<br>
         True writing, in which the content is coded so that another reader can reconstruct the exact written content with some precision, is a later development.<br>
          One of the earliest forms the written expression is cuneiform.
        </p>

                <section>

                   <h2>Cuneiform Script (in German: Keilschrift) <img src="cuneimage.jpg" alt="Cuneiform changes"  width="130" height="110"> </h2>

                   <p>The cuneiform system has been used for more than three millennia <br>
                       through several stages of development, from the 34th century BC Until the 2nd century AD. <br>
                        Eventually, it was completely replaced by alphabetic writing (in the general sense) <br>
                         in the course of Roman times. <br>
                          There are no cuneiform systems in current use. <br>
                          It had to be deciphered as a completely unknown writing system in 19th-century Assyriology.<br>
                           Successful completion of its deciphering is dated to 1857.</p>
                           <br>
                           <p>The cuneiform script underwent considerable changes over a period of more than two millennia.<br>
                              The image below shows the development of the sign SAG "head" (Borger nr. 184, U+12295 ð’Š•).

                                  <li><p>represents the late 3rd millennium</p></li>
                                  <li><p>represents Old Assyrian ductus of the early 2nd millennium, as adopted into Hittite</p></li>
                                  <li><p>is the simplified sign as written by Assyrian scribes in the early 1st millennium and until the script's extinction.</p></li>
