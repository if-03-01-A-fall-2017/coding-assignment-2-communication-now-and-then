    <h1>Social Media</h1>
      <p>Social  media Platforms gained a huge popularatiy in the past years</p>
    <h1>Facebook</h1>
      <p>Facebook is an American for-profit corporation and an online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park,
        California. The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004,
        by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.</p>
        <br>
      <p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however,
        later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools,
        and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities,
        and eventually to high school students as well.
        Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook,
        though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers,
        and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site,
        users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on.
        Users can add other users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos,
        share digital videos and links, use various software applications ,
        and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts.</p>

    <h1>Instagram</h1>
      <p>Was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger</p>
      <p>Instagram lets registered users upload photos or videos to the service. Users can apply various digital filters to their images, and add locations through geotags.
        They can add hashtags to their posts, linking the photos up to other content on Instagram featuring the same subject or overall topic.</p>
        <br>
      <p>After its launch in 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity,
        with one million registered users in two months,
        10 million in a year, and ultimately 700 million as of April 2017.
        Its users have uploaded over 40 billion photos to the service as of October 2015.
        As of April 2017, Instagram Direct has 375 million active users, while, as of June 2017,
        the Instagram Stories functionality has over 250 million active users.</p>
